The vulnerability in the insecure version lies in the lack of input sanitization when assigning the user-provided name to the session variable. This vulnerability opens up the possibility of XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks, where an attacker can inject malicious code or scripts into the user's session, potentially compromising sensitive information or executing harmful actions on behalf of the user.

In contrast, the secure version mitigates this vulnerability by implementing input sanitization using the escapeHTML function. This function escapes special HTML characters in the user input, preventing any injected scripts or malicious code from being executed within the application. By sanitizing user input before assigning it to the session variable, the secure version effectively protects against XSS attacks, ensuring the integrity and security of the application's session management.
